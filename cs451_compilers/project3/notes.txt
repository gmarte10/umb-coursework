1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
   The goal of this project was to learn more about the parser by adding support for extra features. In order
   to implement the parsing of these new features, the java grammar had to be used as a guide. There were also times
   in which helper methods were created to support further grammars that were not in j--. The first problem was about
   parsing long and double basic types. The second part was adding support for the operators introduced in project 2.
   The next things to parse in the same method were conditional expressions, do, for, break, continue, and switch
   statements. Lastly, we also had to add support for exception handlers and interface type declaration, which needed
   other methods in parser to be changed.


2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was a lot more challenging than I expected. I underestimated the time it would take and was
   not able to finish it or get most of the code working. The experience could have went better.
