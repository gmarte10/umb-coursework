1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
   The goal of this project was to get an understanding of the j-- compiler and how it works.
   The first part was learning to use CLEmitter to create a class file for the GenIsPrime java program.
   The other part of the project was to implement unsupported operations in j-- and add new ones using
   the correct precedence rules. In order to do this the major components of the j-- compiler had to be altered.
   First, the token image and kind were placed in the TokenInfo java file. The Scanner was modified to
   find and create the token. The Parser was altered to assign the correct operations and make the AST.
   Lastly, the Expression files were changed to analyze and make the JVM bytecode.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I learned a lot about the j-- compiler by doing this assignment. It was difficult to understand at the
   beginning, but it became more enjoyable as I discovered new things.
