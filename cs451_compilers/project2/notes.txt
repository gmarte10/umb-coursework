1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   The main goal of this project was to modify and learn more about the front end of the j-- compiler,
   which included the TokenInfo and Scanner java files. The first problem was focused on adding multiline
   comments support. To do this a state diagram had to be created to base our code off of.
   The next part of the project was adding support for additional operators and reserved words,
   which was similar to project 1. The last feature to implement was support for long and double literals.
   This part of the project had us extend the existing integer state diagram in order to guide our code.
   The things added to TokenInfo included new operator symbols and new reserved words.
   The Scanner was changed to add the words into the hash table and to scan for the operator symbols.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was interesting as it had a lot of similarities to the first one, but
   there was more subtle complexities involved. It was overall a good learning experience,
   especially when it came to making the state diagrams.
