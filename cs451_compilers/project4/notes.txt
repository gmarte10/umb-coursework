1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
   The goal of the project was to make a generated scanner and parser for j-- using JavaCC. The implementation was done
   by using the Java grammar documentation as a guide and the base j--.jj code. The first part of the assignment was to
   build the scanner by creating the operators and literals added in the previous projects. The next part was to work on
   the parser to support these new features. Lastly, the implementation for things like for, do while, try, error
   handlers and interfaces were added to the parser section. To add all of these parts, several methods based off the
   Java grammar documentation were made as well. Overall, this project was a way to learn about an alternative and
   simpler way to make a parser and scanner.


2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It was interesting to combine the JavaCC code and java code. The project was a bit difficult at the beginning due
   to having to learn how to use JavaCC and the lack of help that IntelliJ provided. However, after spending time
   doing it, things became a lot easier and more enjoyable.
