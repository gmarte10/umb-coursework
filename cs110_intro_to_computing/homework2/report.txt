4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Calculating Edit Distance Using Dynamic Programming): The first
   thing I did was fill in anything I knew that the comments said to do. When I 
   could not figure something out I went and read the checklist. I never 
   read the problems project2 pdf because I thought it said the same thing as
   the checklist like the previous project. This caused me to struggle a lot.
   However, after asking a few questions on piazza and attending a discussion
   session I was able to figure out problem 1.


   Problem 2 (Recovering the Alignment): I was not able to finish this problem.
   The way I first approached it was by filling in any of the code I knew that
   the comments asked me to do. After that I read the checklist. I was 
   extremely confused while reading the checklist and could not make any 
   progress. I reread the lecture slides and read some of the book, but I
   still could not understand things. Eventually, out of curiosity I ended up 
   checking the project 2 pdf. After reading it, a lot of the confusion I had 
   was cleared up. I was finally able to make some progress. Unfortunately, I 
   ended up checking the pdf on the last day to submit files and was not able to 
   finish the problem.

5. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

Tengpeng Li            TA          He helped me understand what problem 1 was
                                   asking for and how to do the format output.

Piazza             Instructors,    The instructor's answers helped me understand
                   Students        what was wrong with my code and why it was
                                   not working. The student's answer's helped
                                   clarify problem 2 a little bit.


6. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   The problems made absolutely no sense to me because I never read the
   project2 pdf until the last day. I have now learned that the first thing I
   need to do is read the project pdf's before doing the problems. I also
   learned that a better way to approach the problems and exercises is to read
   and understand what I am supposed to do instead of randomly trying things
   until it works. The only times I enjoyed doing this project was when my
   code actually worked and when I understood what I was doing.
