3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Markov Model Data Type): I first approached this problem by
   reading the project4.pdf. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to
   thoroughly read the problem as I left project 4 for last minute. I was not
   able to finish this problem even though I spent a lot of time trying to do
   it. The major issue I had was understanding what the problem was asking for.
   The only way I would have understood that was by reading the problem many
   times over, which I could not do. The discussions helped me understand
   some of the problem, which allowed me to at least write some code. Even
   though I was not able to finish the problem, I still made sure it had
   correct styling.

   Problem 2 (Random Text Generator): I could not get to this problem as I was
   not able to finish problem 1. Without doing the first problem, there was no
   way of being able to complete this one. Since I could not complete this
   problem, I focused on at least making sure it had correct styling.

   Problem 3 (Noisy Message Decoder): I was not able to get to this problem as
   well. However, the discussions session helped me to start it. The only
   problem was that I could not finish it as I had not finished the previous
   two problems. I also made sure this problem had correct styling like the
   previous two as it was the least I could do.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

 Tengpeng Li            TA         They helped me understand some of the
                                   problems and exercises. I was able to start
                                   some of the problems with their help.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   The major lesson I got from this project was to not leave everything for
   last and to also get help when I need it. I could have definitely finished
   some of the problems if I got started on the project earlier. Overall this
   project was very difficult, especially when it came to understanding the
   problems. However, I was still able to learn a lot about object oriented 
   programming.
