3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Tour Data Type): I first approached this problem by reading the
   pdf file. After reading it seven to eight times, I finally began to
   understand what I was supposed to be doing. When I started writing the code,
   I also used the checklist to guide me in the right direction. When I got
   stuck, I went to the discussion session to get help. The TA was able to
   clarify my confusion and explain what I was doing wrong. This helped me a
   lot as I was able to make progress on the project. The biggest issue I had
   was getting a fail error for test4 in run_tests.py. This was very
   frustrating as there was not any clear indication of what I was doing wrong.
   After attending the second discussion session I was able to get help and fix
   this issue. It turned out to be a minor iteration problem. After correcting
   that my code was able to work properly.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Tengpeng Li         TA          During the discussion sessions, he
                                   explained what the problem was asking for,
                                   clarified questions and showed how to fix
                                   certain errors in the code. He also helped
                                   me find the minor iteration issue.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project helped me improve my problem solving skills and solidify my
   understanding of object oriented programming. I somewhat enjoyed doing this
   problem because it felt good getting the code to run properly, but it was
   also frustrating when fixing and understanding some parts. Overall this
   project went a lot better than I expected it to.
