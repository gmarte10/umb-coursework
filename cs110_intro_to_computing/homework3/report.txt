3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Ring Buffer): I approached problem 1 by first reading the
   project3.pdf. I was not able to understand a lot of what the problem was
   asking at first. I then tried to complete anything I knew using the
   checklist as help. When I got stuck and couldn't make anymore progress, I
   reread the problem around 10 more times. This helped me understand much
   more of what I was supposed to do. The discussion sessions also helped a lot
   as the TA gave many examples that clarified a lot of the confusion I had.
   Eventually, after rereading the problem many more times, I was able to
   understand and complete it all. The main issues I encountered was sometimes
   getting syntax errors even though the code was clearly written correctly.
   After asking about it on Piazza, I was told to check previous code for any
   errors. I did this and was able to resolve the issues I was having. Another
   problem I had was doing the enqueue and dequeue functions because I did not
   know how they worked. I was able to do them after rereading the problem a
   few more times and getting help from the TA during the discussion sessions.


   Problem 2 (Guitar String): The way I approached this problem was similar to
   problem 1. I reread the pdf and checklist many times over again until I
   was able to understand what the problem was asking for. Afterwards I used
   the checklist as a guide to help me do the problem. The explanation and
   examples the TA gave during the discussion sessions also helped clarify
   questions I had. The major issue I had was similar to problem one where
   there was a syntax error even though the code was written correctly. I fixed
   this by going back and correcting any other errors I had in the previous
   code. I also had some minor calculation errors with the tic(string)
   function, but was able to fix it by rewriting my code in a different way.
   Eventually, I was able to complete all of problem 2.


4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

Tengpeng Li            TA          He explained problem 1 and 2 in more detail
                                   that helped me understand them better. He
                                   also showed a lot of examples that helped me
                                   understand what I was supposed to be doing
                                   and clarified questions I had.

Piazza             Instructor's    I asked why I was getting a syntax error on
                   answer          Piazza and the instructor's answer said to
                                   check my previous code for any errors.


5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project seemed nearly impossible when I first looked at it. However,
   after reading it many times over I was finally able to understand what was
   going on. I learned a lot more about defining functions as well. I did not
   enjoy the project a lot at first, but towards the end it became more
   interesting and doable.
