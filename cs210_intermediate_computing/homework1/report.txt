3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Model a Percolation System): I first approached the problem
   by reading the pdf and the checklist line by line and taking notes
   on the most important parts. I made sure to understand each word
   that was being said. The main issues I had with this problem was
   connecting the neighboring sites in the open method and also fixing the
   backwash. I solved the open method by fixing the conditions in the if
   statements, which was recommended to me by the SI instructor. I solved
   the backwash issue by making the isFull method check if a site was
   connected to the top row in the second uf object I made. Overall this
   problem took me the most time to understand and do.


   Problem 2 (Estimate Percolation Threshold): I approached this problem
   similar to the first by reading the pdf and checklist line by line,
   while annotating at the same time. I had to reread a bit more in order
   to catch all the small details. The issue I had with this problem was
   getting the correct precision and numbers for my answers. I
   solved this by type casting everything I could into doubles. I was still
   not able to get the exact numbers at the end, but it was extremely
   close and passed all the tests. Another minor issue I had was
   calculating the mean and stddev. I was able to fix this quickly by
   using the StdStats methods.


4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Suncharn         SI             He helped me debug my code by telling
   Pipithkul        Instructor     me what I was doing wrong. He also
                                   gave lectures on the problems that
                                   made it easier to understand them.

   James            TA             He gave a lot of useful tips and
   Michaud                         hints during the discussion
                                   sessions. He also explained what we
                                   had to for the exercises and
                                   problems in a way that was
                                   understandable.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I enjoyed doing this project a lot because I was able to learn so
   much from it. The exercises and problems helped me understand how
   Java works and made it easier to learn everything that was being
   taught during lectures. It felt really good being able to get the
   code working correctly, especially after hours of struggle. The
   most frustrating part about this project was problem 1. Attending
   most of the SI sessions was also a great help.
