3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Board Data Type):
   An issue that took me a while to figure out was why my Manhattan and
   Hamming distance were always a bit off. At first I thought it was my
   calculations, but I used them in examples and they seemed to work fine.
   I then decided to try and separate the calculations using two separate
   nested for loops. This only gave me more problems. After reviewing my
   code, I realized that the way I was getting the correct position was
   probably off. Instead of using a constant number and increasing it
   each iteration, I decided to use a formula. I used the one from blankPos()
   to calculate the correct position, which ended up working because it was
   more accurate.


   Problem 2 (Solver Data Type):
   The most frustrating issue I had was not being able to compare the
   iterated neighboring board with the previous board. I kept getting an
   error no matter how I restructured it. I then took time to try understand
   the code completely. Doing this, I realized that the neighboring board
   could not be compared to node.previous.board in the first iteration
   because the previous board was null. Due to this I added another condition
   to check if the previous board is null and then insert a new search node
   because the neighboring board is obviously different from null.


4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   James Michaud        TA         He gave helpful hints during discussion
                                   sessions for finding inversions
                                   and obtaining the solution of a node.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This assignment was overall pretty difficult compared to the other ones.
   The thing that helped me the most was commenting on most of my code as
   that made it easier to understand what I was doing. This project allowed
   me to learn a lot more about things like Queues and Stacks, which was
   something that I was having trouble conceptualizing before. This project
   also helped motivate me to pay more attention in class as I noticed a
   lot of the material was covered in lectures and would have made the
   project easier. Something I would change in the future would be
   simplifying a lot of my code.
